# Shadows of the Crown
**Shadows of the Crown** is a 2D RPG set in the medieval era. You take on the role of a Royal Guard, entrusted by the King with the mission of finding those responsible for the murder of a high-ranking nobleman at the royal court. As you conduct your investigation, you uncover that the crime was a carefully orchestrated act by an organized group, and shadows are gathering over the entire kingdom...

## Technologies used
The game engine is written in C++ using the SDL2 library. The game communicates in a separate thread with a server written in Python, which in turn processes the GPT-2 language model and then passes the model's output to the game. This makes the game dynamic, and the interactions with NPCs during gameplay are varied.
