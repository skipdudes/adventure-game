Tall size characters for 'RPG Maker MV'.

This is a remake of the walking graphics of the characters in the img/characters folder, which is one of the official materials of 'RPG Maker MV' (©KADOKAWA CORPORATION).
The proportion of the character's  has been slim and the size has been changed from 48x48 pixels to 48x72 pixels.
The file name is the same, so you can overwrite the project file and use it.
Of course, you can also rename it.
