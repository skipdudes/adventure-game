<h1>How to use these materials</h1>
<p>
Images included in the 'ex_characters' folder are additional materials not included in the standard materials.<br />
Here, we will introduce how to use these materials.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Undeads</h2>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/Undead.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
'Undead.png' is for skeletons in the upper row and for zombies in the lower row.<br />
Also, from the left, adult men, adult women, children, and large people are arranged.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/exUndead_en.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" />
</figure>
<p>
Skeletons and zombies can be used naked as they are, but I think it would be interesting to combine them with other characters as shown in this picture.<br />
Such processing is possible with any graphic tool that has a layer function.
</p>

<h2>Succubus and Angel</h2>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/Succubus.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
The upper left of the 'Succubus.png' is the same as the lower right of 'Monster2.png', so to speak, a completed sample.<br />
Others are parts to be combined.<br />
It is assumed that it will be used by overlapping with a graphic tool with a layer function.<br />
No incubus is provided.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/Angel.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
The upper left of the 'Angel.png' is the same as the upper right of 'Monster2.png', so to speak, a completed sample.<br />
Others are parts to be combined.<br />
It is assumed that it will be used by overlapping with a graphic tool with a layer function.<br />
The body is female, but I don't think angels are male or female.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/exAngel_en.png" width="144" height="288" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
This is an example of adding wings and angel rings to a normal character.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/exAngel2_en.png" width="300" height="300" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
A succubus is a type of demon, so it might be interesting to use it for whispering between demon and angel.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Snakepeople</h2>
<figure>
<img src="img/snakepeople_en.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" />
</figure>
<p>
The top left of '!SnakePeople1.png' is an adult male body, and the right is an adult female.<br />
The lower left is men's hair and clothes, but if you adjust the position, you can also use it for women.<br />
The right side is the hair and clothes for women.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/exSnakepeople_en.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" />
</figure>
<p>
Let's make your favorite Snake People (Naga, Lamia, Gorgon) by combining various bodies.<br />
It is assumed that it will be used by overlapping with a graphic tool with a layer function.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/!SnakePeople2.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
'!SnakePeople2.png' is an example combination, and of course you can use it as is.<br />
On the bottom right are two kinds of wings adjusted for Snake People. It is suitable for women's height, but if you raise the position, it can also be used by men.
</p>
<p>
Be sure to add &quot;!&quot; to the file name when using it. If you don't, it will be displayed strangely on the top.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Statues</h2>
<figure>
<img src="img/comic_en.png" width="192" height="432" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
It's good that the character has a tall body, but the statues in RPG Maker MV have a small head, and I don't think they're modeled after the same species.<br />
So I made some statues that were aligned with tall characters.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/$Statue.png" width="240" height="384" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
It is assumed to be placed in the 'characters' folder and set in the event, but you can also put it in the tileset and use it.<br />
As it is, '$Statue.png' is 6x4 instead of 3x4, which is the character standard, so please delete unnecessary parts or copy it to an appropriate character set and use it.<br />
Since it is oriented from top to bottom, left, right, and up, it is the same direction as a normal character, so you can specify the direction with [Set Movement Route].<br />
From left to right: no pedestal, with pedestal, neck and no pedestal, with neckless pedestal<br />
As for the swordsman, there are only right and left facing, and in the remaining parts, a beautiful pedestal, a slightly weathered pedestal, a broken pedestal, and a shadow are placed.<br />
It is assumed that it will be used by overlapping with a graphic tool with a layer function.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/!StatueOption.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
'!StatueOption.png' is an option to be added to the statue (goddess statue), and it is assumed that it is placed in the charcter folder and set to the event, but please use it freely by processing it, such as combining it with the statue from the beginning.<br />
On the left, 8 types of orbs blink with a [Stepping] animation.<br />
The first row on the right is the orb that lost its light, cup, and pot, the second row is the cup with the liquid, the third row is the water falling from the pot up to the pedestal, the fourth row is the water falling from the pot up to the ground.<br />
Rows 2 to 4 also support [Stepping] animation.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/orb.png" width="327" height="240" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
This is an example of orb usage.<br />
There are several ways to create a display similar to this one, such as creating a character that combines a statue and an orb, or placing a statue in a tileset and placing only the orb in an event.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/pot.png" width="387" height="228" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
This is an example of how to use cups and pot.<br />
Use it in the same way as the Orb, in a way that is convenient for you.
</p>

<h2>Maid</h2>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/Maid.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
A 'Maid.png' is assumed that it will be used by overlapping with a graphic tool with a layer function.<br />
In addition, there are also 5 pre-assembled characters, so please copy them to an appropriate character file using a graphic tool etc. and use them.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/Maid2.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
A 'Maid2.png' is an additional variation that also includes children and fairies.<br />
There are also 6 pre-assembled ones.<br />
Butler is not provided.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Men in robes</h2>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/menInRobes1.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
A 'menInRobes1.png' is great for making robed characters in temples.<br />
It is assumed that it will be used by overlapping with a graphic tool with a layer function.<br />
The upper row is an adult male, the lower row is an adult female, the first character from the left is the one with the hood removed, and the second character is the one with the hood.<br />
For the rest, there are also 4 pre-assembled ones.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/menInRobes2.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
A 'menInRobes2.png' is 8 pre-assembled characters, again adult males in the upper row and adult females in the lower row.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Nurse</h2>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/Nurse1.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
A 'Nurse1.png' is assumed that it will be used by overlapping with a graphic tool with a layer function.<br />
The lower right is almost the same as the lower right of 'SF_People3.png', but the clothes have been adjusted so that it can be used as the state before transforming into the 6th character in 'SF_Enemy1.png'.
</p>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/Nurse2.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
A 'Nurse2.png' is a color variation. The top and bottom are the same except for the hair color.<br />
Male nurses are not available.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Others</h2>
<p>
'Monster2.png' and 'Monster2_Damage.png' are newly created by selecting 8 monsters that have battle images but no walking graphics.<br />
A 'Fantasy_ex1.png' is a collection of miscellaneous things, a living warrior and an uninjured werewolf, and the rest is material without the human body for combination.<br />
'$Darklord.png' created a new walking graphic for a medium-sized monster with a tall size instead of the walking graphic for a four-legged walking Darklord, which was lost when the Darklord was transformed into a tall-sized monster.
</p>
<p>
'SF_ex1.png', 'SF_ex2.png', 'SF_ex3.png' are also additional variations. If you look at it, you'll understand! (description omitted)
</p>
<p>
'$acquire_chan.png', '$marsha_erin.png', '$SailorMasha.png' are additional characters.<br />
For copyright information, please refer to 'Read me.txt'.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Doors</h2>
<p>
The scale of the other furniture is roughly the same, but the standard square door is the size that you have to squat down to pass through, so I made a door that fits the three-headed character.<br />
Please use it because it is in the 'doors' folder.
